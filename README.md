# Scribble-Pad
This extension is used to scribble on the screen.
“Scribble Pad” extension:
This google chrome extension has been developed by me as a scribble pad. It enables the user to write or scribble notes/text on any web-page opened in google chrome browser. This extension is very helpful to mark important points and to make notes on the web-page itself.
How I created it:
1)	First I made the “manifest.json” file.
2)	Thereafter I made “content.js” file.
3)	In the “content.js” file I created a canvas that fills the entire space of the browser so that it allows users to write on the canvas. The net result is that though we are writing on the canvas we get an impression that we are writing on a web-page. The combined effect of web-page and the canvas can be stored for future use as pdf, etc.
